# FSM---Controlled-Neural-Interference-core-in-verilog
This project implements a Verilog-based gesture recognition accelerator optimized for low-power edge AI applications. The design simulates a simple hardware pipeline that includes gesture input handling, MAC (Multiply-Accumulate) operations, and a control FSM (Finite State Machine) for processing logic.
